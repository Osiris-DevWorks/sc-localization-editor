"""Spanish is shipped as an available, human-translated language.

Locks the activation done for the Thord82 contribution:
  * the real ``languages/spanish/ui.json`` parses and is in the ``{ht, at}``
    shape (no leftover flat-string leaves from the pre-#182 contribution),
  * Spanish appears in the language selector (it is no longer a stub),
  * the SC language id maps to ``spanish_(spain)`` so apply-to-game writes the
    Localization folder and ``g_language`` the game actually loads,
  * ``languages/sources.json`` carries a Spanish base.ini URL.

These guard against a key bump or a revert silently breaking the shipped
Spanish language.
